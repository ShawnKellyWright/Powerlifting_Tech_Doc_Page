        <article>
            <p>Throughout this rule book, for reasons of brevity, wherever the words “he” or “his” occur, such reference
                is deemed
                apply to either sex. All references to gender should be revised to secure equal rights for both genders,
                and not
                mentioned women as something that need separate rules, like in the below example from the Weighing In.
                In
                competitions in which both sexes are competing</p>
            <ol>
                <li>(a) T h e International Powerlifting Federation recognizes the following lifts which must be taken
                    in the same
                    sequence in all competitions conducted under IPF rules: <br>
                    <code class="tab">A. Squat B. Bench Press C.
                        Deadlift D. Total</code>
                    <p>(b) Competition takes place between lifters in categories defined by sex, body weight and age.
                        The
                        Men’s and
                        Women’s Open Championships permit lifters of any age in excess of 14 years.<br>
                        (c) In the event of a Powerlifting or Bench Press Championships being combined e.g. with a
                        Sub-Junior, Junior Open
                        & Master's Championships having both Classic and Equipped, a lifter has the option of competing
                        in
                        both
                        Championships. The athlete shall be required pay entry fee for both championships and will be
                        required to
                        compete twice. Once the athlete is entered on the Preliminary Nomination, he/she may not change
                        their age
                        division. The lifter may only change the weight class on the Final Nomination.<br>
                        (d) The rules apply to all levels of competition.<br>
                        (e) Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each lift. The lifter’s best valid attempt on
                        each
                        lift counts toward
                        his competition total. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks
                        above
                        the heavier lifter.<br>
                        (f) If two lifters register the same bodyweight at the weigh in and eventually achieve the same
                        total at the end of
                        the competition, the lifter making the total first will take precedence over the other lifter.
                        Where
                        awards are
                        presented for best squat, bench press and deadlift or if a world record is broken, the same
                        procedure will apply.</p>

                    <code>
                        <li>The lifter shall face the front of the platform. The bar shall be held horizontally across
                            the shoulders, hands
                            and fingers gripping the bar. The hands may be positioned anywhere on the bar inside and or
                            in contact with the
                            inner collars.
                        </li>
                        <li>After removing the bar from the racks, (the lifter may be aided in removal of the bar from
                            the racks by the
                            spotter / loaders) the lifter must move backwards to establish the starting position. When
                            the lifter is
                            motionless, erect (slight deviation is allowable) with knees locked the Chief Referee will
                            give the signal to
                            begin the lift. The signal shall consist of a downward movement of the arm and the audible
                            command “Squat”.
                            Before receiving the signal to “squat” the lifter may make any position adjustments within
                            the rules, without
                            penalty. For reasons of safety the lifter will be requested to “Replace” the bar, together
                            with a backward
                            movement of the arm, if after a period of five seconds he is not in the correct position to
                            begin the lift. The
                            Chief Referee will then convey the reason why the signal was not given.</li>
                        <li>Upon receiving the Chief Referee’s signal the lifter must bend the knees and lower the body
                            until the top
                            surface of the legs at the hip joint is lower than the top of the knees. Only one decent
                            attempt is allowed.
                            The attempt is deemed to have commenced when the lifters knees have unlocked.
                        </li>
                        <li>The lifter must recover at will to an upright position with the knees locked. Double
                            bouncing at the bottom of
                            the squat attempt or any downward movement is not permitted. When the lifter is motionless
                            (in the apparent
                            final position) the Chief Referee will give the signal to rack the bar.</li>
                        <li>The signal to rack the bar will consist of a backward motion of the arm and the audible
                            command “Rack”.
                            The lifter must then return the bar to the racks. Foot movement after the rack signal will
                            not be cause for
                            failure. For reasons of safety the lifter may request the aid of the spotter/loaders in
                            returning the bar to, and
                            replacing it in the racks. The lifter must stay with the bar during this process.
                        </li>
                        <li>Not more than five and not less than two spotter/loaders shall be on the platform at any
                            time. The Referees
                            may decide to the number of spotter/loadersrequired on the platform at any time 2, 3, 4, or

                            the lifter shall wait with
                            straight arms elbows locked for the Chief Referee’s signal. The signal shall be given as
                            soon as the lifter is
                            motionless and the bar properly positioned. For reasons of safety the lifter will be
                            requested to “Replace” the
                            bar, together with a backward movement of the arm, if after a period of five seconds he is
                            not in the correct
                            position to begin the lift. The Chief Referee will then convey the reason why the signal was
                            not given.</li>
                        <li>The signal to begin the attempt shall consist of a downward movement of the arm together
                            with the audible
                            command “Start”.
                        </li>
                        <li>After receiving the signal, the lifter must lower the bar to the chest or abdominal area
                            (the bar shall not touch
                            the belt), hold it motionless, after which the Chief referee will signal the audible command
                            “Press”. The lifter
                            must then return the bar to straight arms’ length elbows locked. When held motionless in
                            this position the
                            audible command “Rack” shall be given together with a backward motion of the arm. If the bar
                            is lowered to
                            the belt or does not touch the chest or abdominal area, the Chief Referee´s command is
                            “Rack”.</li>

            <p><strong>Rules for the disabled competing in IPF single lift Bench Press championships</strong><br>
                Bench press championships shall be organized without a special division for disabled lifters e.g. blind,
                sight
                impaired, mobility impaired. They may be assisted to, and from, the bench. Assisted to mean “with the
                help of
                the coach or/and with use of crutches, sticks/canes or wheelchair”. The rules of competition apply
                equally to
                that of the able bodied. For lifters who have an amputated lower limb, a prosthetic device shall be
                considered
                the same as the natural limb. The lifter shall be weighed in without the device, with compensatory
                weight
                added according to the established fraction chart. Refer to WEIGHING IN item 5. For lifters with
                dysfunctional lower limbs that require leg braces or similar devices for walking, the device shall be
                considered
                as part of the natural limb and the lifter shall be weighed in wearing the device.</p>

                    <li>If not already done, lots will be drawn to establish the order of weigh in. The lots drawn also
                        establish the order of
                        lifting throughout the competition when lifters require the same weights for their attempts.
                    </li>
                    <li>The weigh in period will last one and a half hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>The weigh in for each competitor will be carried out in a room with the door closed, with only
                        the competitor, his coach
                        or manager and the two/three referees present. For reasons of hygiene the lifter should wear
                        socks / paper towel on the

                    <li>Lifters may be weighed nude or in underwear which complies with the specifications set out in
                        the appropriate section
                        of the rule book and which does not effectively change the lifter’s weight. If a question exists
                        regarding weight of
                        undergarments, a re-weigh in the nude may be requested. “In competitions in which both sexes are
                        competitors, the
                        weigh in procedure may be altered to ensure that lifters are weighed by officials of their own
                        sex. Additional officials
                        (not necessarily referees) may be appointed for this purpose”. <br>
                        Disabled/Amputee lifters who are competing in bench press championships will have the following

                        For each below the ankle amputation = 1/54 of bodyweight <br>
                        For each below the knee amputation = 1/36 of bodyweight <br>
                        For each above the knee amputation = 1/18 of bodyweight <br>
                        For each hip disarticulation = 1/9 of bodyweight<br>
                        For lifters with dysfunctional lower limbs that require leg braces or similar devices for
                        walking, the device shall be
                        considered as part of the natural limb and the lifter shall be weighed in wearing the device.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each lifter may only be weighed once. Only those whose bodyweight is heavier or lighter than the
                        category limits of the
                        category entered are allowed to return to the scales. They must return to the scales and make
                        weight within the limits of
                        the hour and a half allowed for the weigh in; otherwise they will be eliminated from the
                        competition. A lifter can only be
                        re-weighed as often as time and orderly progression by lots allows. A lifter may only be weighed
                        outside the time limit
                        of one and a half hours if he presents himself within the time limit, but due to the number of
                        lifters trying to make
                        weight, he is denied the opportunity of mounting the scales. He may then be allowed one re-weigh
                        at the discretion of
                        the referees. The lifter’s agreed bodyweight must not be made public until all lifters competing
                        in the particular
                        category/categories have been weighed in.</li>
                    <li>A lifter may only weigh in the category in which he was nominated 21 days prior to the meet
                        date.
                        In the case where groups are formed in a particular weight class the B and C groups may lift at
                        a separate and earlier
                        time to the A group. Where groups lift at separate times in this way the A group must have a
                        minimum of 8 (eight) and a
                        maximum of 14 (fourteen) lifters.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lifters should check squat and bench press rack heights and foot blocks prior to the start of
                        the competition. The rack
                        height sheet must be signed or initialed after the check by the lifter or coach. It is in their
                        interest. A copy of this official
                        document goes to the Jury, Speaker, and Platform Manager.

            <p><strong>The Round System</strong><br>
                (a) At the weigh in, the lifter or his coach must declare a starting weight for all three lifts. These
                must be entered on the
                appropriate first attempt card, signed by the lifter or his coach and retained by the official
                conducting the weigh in.
                The speaker’s card is deemed to be the appropriate first attempt card. The lifter will then be given
                eleven blank
                attempt cards for use during the competition. Three for the squat, three for the bench press, and five
                for the deadlift.
                Each lift distinguished by using a different coloured card. Having made his first attempt at a lift, the
                lifter or his
                coach must decide upon the weight required for his second attempt. This weight must be filled in where
                indicated
                upon the card and submitted to the competition secretary or other appointed official before the
                one-minute time
                allowance has elapsed. The same procedure is to be used for the second and third attempts on all three
                lifts.
                Responsibility for submitting attempts within the time limit rests solely with the lifter or his coach.
                Under the round
                system, the need for numerous marshals is eliminated, the attempt card being handed directly to the
                designated
                official. Examples of attempt cards are illustrated. Remember that the box for first attempts on the
                cards in the
                lifter’s possession is only to be used for the permitted first attempt change if required. Similarly,
                the fourth and fifth boxes on the
                deadlift card are only to be used for the two permitted changes on the third attempt deadlift if
                required. In
                single bench press competitions a card similar to that of the deadlift will be used. <br>(b) Where 10 or
                more lifters are competing in a session, groups may be formed consisting of approximately equal
                numbers of lifters. However, groups must be formed when 15 or more lifters are competing in the same
                session. A
                session can be composed of a single bodyweight category or any combination of bodyweight categories at
                the
                discretion of the organizer for purpose of presentation. In single lift Bench Press Championships groups
                of up to
                twenty may be formed.
                Grouping shall be determined by examining the lifters’ best totals achieved at national or international
                level during
                the previous twelve months. The lifters with the lowest totals will form the first group to lift with
                progressively
                higher totals forming further groups as necessary. Where a lifter has not provided a total for the
                previous twelve
                months, then that lifter shall automatically be placed in the first group to lift. <br> (c) Each lifter
                will take his first attempt in the first round, his second attempt in the second round and his third
                attempt
                in the third round. <br> (d) When a group consists of less than 6 lifters, compensatory time allowances
                shall be added at the end of each round
                as follows: For 5 lifters add 1 minute; 4 lifters add 2 minutes; 3 lifters add 3 minutes. 3 minutes is
                the maximum
                allowance permitted at the end of a round. Should a lifter follow himself when the compensatory clock is
                in
                operation, 3 minutes is the maximum allowance permitted. For compensatory time where groups are
                involved,
                unloading of the bar will take place at the end of the compensatory time, reloaded, then the one minute
                to begin the
                attempt. <br> (e) The bar must be loaded progressively during each round on the principle of a rising
                bar. At no time will the weight
                on the bar be lowered within a round except for errors as described in item (i), and then only at the
                end of a round. <br> (f) Lifting order within each round will be determined by the lifter’s choice of
                weight for that round. In the event of
                two lifters choosing the same weight, the lifter with the lowest lot number drawn at the weigh in, will
                lift first. The
                same applies to third round deadlift attempts, whereby the weight may be changed twice, subject to the
                bar not
                having already been loaded to the lifters originally chosen weight and the lifter having been called to
                the bar by the
                speaker. <br> Example: Lifter A with lot number 5 puts in 250.0 kg. <br>
                Lifter B with lot number 2 puts in 252.5 kg.<br>
                Lifter A fails with 250.0 kg. Can Lifter B drop the weight to 250.0 kg to win? <br>
                No, the order of lifting is still determined by the lot number.<br> (g) If unsuccessful with an attempt,
                the lifter does not follow himself, but must wait until the next round before he can
                attempt that weight again.
