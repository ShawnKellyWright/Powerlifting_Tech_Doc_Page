        <article>
            <p>Throughout this rule book, for reasons of brevity, wherever the words “he” or “his” occur, such reference
                is deemed
                apply to either sex. All references to gender should be revised to secure equal rights for both genders,
                and not
                mentioned women as something that need separate rules, like in the below example from the Weighing In.
                In
                competitions in which both sexes are competing</p>
            <ol>
                <li>(a) T h e International Powerlifting Federation recognizes the following lifts which must be taken
                    in the same
                    sequence in all competitions conducted under IPF rules: <br>
                    <code class="tab">A. Squat B. Bench Press C.
                        Deadlift D. Total</code>
                    <p>(b) Competition takes place between lifters in categories defined by sex, body weight and age.
                        The
                        Men’s and
                        Women’s Open Championships permit lifters of any age in excess of 14 years.<br>
                        (c) In the event of a Powerlifting or Bench Press Championships being combined e.g. with a
                        Sub-Junior, Junior Open
                        & Master's Championships having both Classic and Equipped, a lifter has the option of competing
                        in
                        both
                        Championships. The athlete shall be required pay entry fee for both championships and will be
                        required to
                        compete twice. Once the athlete is entered on the Preliminary Nomination, he/she may not change
                        their age
                        division. The lifter may only change the weight class on the Final Nomination.<br>
                        (d) The rules apply to all levels of competition.<br>
                        (e) Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each lift. The lifter’s best valid attempt on
                        each
                        lift counts toward
                        his competition total. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks
                        above
                        the heavier lifter.<br>
                        (f) If two lifters register the same bodyweight at the weigh in and eventually achieve the same
                        total at the end of
                        the competition, the lifter making the total first will take precedence over the other lifter.
                        Where
                        awards are
                        presented for best squat, bench press and deadlift or if a world record is broken, the same
                        procedure will apply.</p>
